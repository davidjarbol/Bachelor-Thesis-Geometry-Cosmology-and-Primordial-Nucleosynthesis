# Bachelor-Thesis-Geometry-Cosmology-and-Primordial-Nucleosynthesis
Bachelor’s thesis (57 pages) on the expanding geometry of the universe, its early thermodynamic stages up to nucleosynthesis, and the simulation of the evolution of the first light element abundances during this epoch with Mathematica.

Final Score (Presentation and Report): 9.9/10.

Undergraduate Research Scholarship (January 2023 - June 2023) by Banco Santander. Academic Excellence Scholarship (University of Granada, Spain)

◦ Award to the top 100 students across all disciplines at the University of Granada.

◦ Collaborated with a research group in the Department of Theoretical Physics for six months, during which I developed my Bachelor’s thesis.


Language: Mathematica

Objetives:

◦ Synthesized the mathematical foundations of Pseudo-Euclidean Spaces and Pseudo-Riemannian Manifolds, which form the basis for General Relativity.

◦ Derived the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric and the Friedmann equations governing the expansion of the universe, and estimated its age based on cosmological parameters.

◦ Developed the Statistical Physics and Thermodynamics used to describe the universe’s evolution and analysed the thermodynamic stages of the early universe up to nucleosynthesis.

◦ Focused on nucleosynthesis, calculating light element abundances and simulating their formation.
